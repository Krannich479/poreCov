## What is this Repo?

* an attempt to streamline the usage of various nCov analysis workflows
* the main focus is stability and easy to use for the User

### Easy Installation

* just copy the commands into your terminal to set everything up

```bash
sudo apt-get update

curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash 
sudo mv nextflow /bin/
sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
