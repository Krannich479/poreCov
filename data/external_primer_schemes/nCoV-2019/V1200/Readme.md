Based on the original V1200 primer-set (also known as Midnight primer).

* add 5 µl of each primer to a 1.5 ml Eppendort-cup labelled either "Pool 1" (all uneven numbers, e.g.: 1, 3, 5,...) or "Pool 2" (all even numbers, e.g.: 2, 4, 6, ...) 

Changes:
* Feb 2022:
    * included modified primer "28_Left", due to primer drop-outs with the Omicron-lineage
        * switches second to last "C" to "T" (27837T)
        * give additional 5 µl of this primer to primer-pool 2
* Mar 2022:
    * included modified primer "21_Right", adapted to the new Omicron BA.2-lineage
        * give additional 5 µl of this primer to primer-pool 1
* Aug 2022:
    * replaced primer "21_BA.2_RIGHT", due to primer drop-outs as a result of a deletion in bp-positions 21765-21770 in Omicron-lineage BA.5
        * new universal-primer, useable for all current Omikron-Lineages
        * give additional 5 µl of this primer to primer-pool 1
* Dec 2022:
    * replaced primer "5_LEFT" with a newly designed primer due to primer drop-outs following a mutation in old primer binding site
    * replaced primer "24_LEFT" with a newly designed primer due to primer drop-outs following a mutation in old primer binding site
    * included modified primer "SARSCoV_1200_22_RIGHT_22603G" due to primer drop-outs with Omicron-sublineages
        * switches base 14 of the primer from "C" to "G" (22603G)
        * give additional 5 µl of this primer to primer-pool 2
